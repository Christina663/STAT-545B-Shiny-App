I picked Option B from the assignment - to make my own Shiny app. 

## Repository structure:
This repository contains:
Steam Games Shiny App - folder of 

## Description of the App:
The app demonstrates the number of games released on Steam each year. The histogram shows a trend of gradual increased number of games as time goes by, 
with a peak occuring around 2018. The table displays the plotted data, including the name, release date, developer and original price of the games. 
Users are welcomed to interact with the plot and table: You can drag the slide bar to change the range of release year, and you can also use the select menu 
to filter the price range of games. The plot and table update automatically!

## Data Source:
The data of steam games come from the UBC-MDS/datateachr package. 
The data set can be accessed by following this link to the Github repository of the datateachr package: https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datateachr.
